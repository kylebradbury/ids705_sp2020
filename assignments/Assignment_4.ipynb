Initialize your means by selecting a set of $k$ points at random from your dataset and using those values as the initial means. You may need to run your algorithm multiple times with different initializations (picking the clustering with the lower dissimilarity measure) to get the best results.

    "**(a)** Reduce the dimensionality of the data with PCA for data visualization. Load the `scikit-learn` digits dataset. Apply PCA and reduce the data (with the associated cluster labels 0-9) into a 2-dimensional space. Plot the data with labels in this two dimensional space (labels can be colors, shapes, or using the actual numbers to represent the data - definitely include a legend in your plot).\n",

Briefly comment on how this may impact how well-clustered the data are. *You can use the `explained_variance_` attribute of the PCA module in `scikit-learn` to assist with this question*\n",

    "**(c)** Reduce the dimensionality of the data with t-SNE for data visualization. T-distributed stochastic neighborhood embedding (t-SNE) is a nonlinear dimensionality reduction technique that is particularly adept at embedding the data into lower 2 or 3 dimensional spaces. Apply t-SNE to the digits dataset and plot it in 2-dimensions (with associated cluster labels 0-9). You may need to adjust the parameters to get acceptable performance. You can read more about how to use t-SNE effectively [here](https://distill.pub/2016/misread-tsne/).\n",

    "**(a)** Create a neural network class that follows the `scikit-learn` classifier convention by implementing `fit`, `predict`, and `predict_proba` methods. Your `fit` method should run backpropagation on your training data using stochastic gradient descent. Assume the activation function is a sigmoid. Choose your model architecture to have two input nodes, two hidden layers with five nodes each, and one output node.\n",

    "One of the greatest challenges of this implementations is that there are many parts and a bug could be present in any of them. I would strongly encourage you to create unit tests for most modules. Without doing this will make your code extremely difficult to bug. You can create simple examples to feed through the network to validate it is correctly computing activations and node values. Also, if you manually set the weights of the model, you can even calculate backpropagation by hand for some simple examples (admittedly, that unit test would be challenging, but a unit test is possible). You can also verify the performance of your overall neural network by comparing it against the `scikit-learn` implementation and using the same architecture and parameters as your model."

Train and test your model on this dataset plotting your learning curves (training and validation error for each epoch of stochastic gradient descent, where an epoch represents having trained on each of the training samples one time).
